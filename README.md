Selenium Concepts Explained
1. Handling Pop-ups
Pop-ups can be JavaScript alerts, confirmation dialogs, prompt pop-ups, or browser-based modal dialogs. Selenium provides mechanisms to interact with these, such as switching to the alert box, sending input to prompts, and handling pop-ups triggered by user actions.
2. Frame Handling
A frame (or iframe) is an HTML element that embeds another document within a webpage. Since frames work independently, Selenium must explicitly switch to a frame before interacting with elements inside it. There are multiple methods to switch between frames, including identification via name, index, or WebElement.
3. Window Handles
When a web application opens multiple browser windows or tabs, Selenium identifies them using window handles (unique identifiers assigned to each open window). To interact with a specific window, Selenium must retrieve its handle, switch to it, perform actions, and then return to the main window.
4. Broken Links
Broken links refer to URLs that do not lead to valid web pages, often resulting in HTTP errors like 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error). Selenium can be used in combination with HTTP requests to identify broken links by checking the response status codes of website hyperlinks.
5. Action Class
The Actions class in Selenium enables complex user interactions such as mouse hovering, right-clicking (context-click), double-clicking, drag-and-drop, and keyboard shortcuts. This is crucial for automating scenarios that involve advanced UI interactions beyond simple click commands.
6. Waits in Selenium
Waits help synchronize test execution with dynamic web pages by ensuring Selenium waits for elements to load before performing actions. There are three types:
- Implicit Wait – Applies a default waiting time for all elements globally.
- Explicit Wait – Waits for specific conditions like element visibility before proceeding.
- Fluent Wait – Allows flexible polling intervals while ignoring certain exceptions
